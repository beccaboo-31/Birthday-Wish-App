You've been an embodiment of calmness and stability for as long as I've known you.\nUnlike calmness of the stale water, your calmness is of that of the running stream. Through the years, I've seen you strive for something new, something better and try to achieve it. May it be something artsy, something literary, or something totally new and brave like the flash mob.\nYou've always flown like a stream into them, and all the while stayed calm. And there are very few people that I know of, having this unique combination of two.\nCombine all of the above with the skill and perseverence you posses, you're destined for great places.\nNever stop trying new experiences out and stay like the calm flowing stream!\nHappy 22nd Birthday, Ashna 😁🥳",
