# Birthday Wish App

This is a perfect app for making your friend's birthday (especially in quarantine) a memorable one! An app that shows a collection of images and birthday wishes!

## Prerequistes
- Android SDK / Android Studio
- Flutter
- Text editor like VS Code

## How to Use

All you got to do is make changes in the *data.json* file

## How to Build

For minimizing app size use following commands to build the app :
```bash
>flutter clean
>flutter build appbundle --target-platform android-arm,android-arm64
```

### Additional Notes

- For security and privacy purposes one may use offline images.
- A 512x512 resolution image looks clear and image size will merely be ~150KB
- This won't make the app bulky, and the complete app can be <10MB by excluding extra bundles.
